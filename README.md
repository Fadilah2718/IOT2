Linear Regression 
01
OURS : Given 4 points in x,y like below (3,8) , (9,6) , (5,4) , (3,2) and got the line in DashBoard as well as the points 
02
HERS : Given a dataset Linear and Multiple Linear Regression is done and the predicted value is shown in debug as well as chart 
09
THEIRS : Generate random values and display x y and preditcted y

KMeans
03
OURS : Kmeans cluster and graph( plot ) from dataset is displayed 
04
HERS : KMeans cluster is shown in tablular column format 

Data From Senosr 
06
MINE : Motion Deteiction using IR sensor - My name is present

Data from Random 
05
OURS : Random data generation using the function node and storing in csv

Logistic Regression 
07
OURS-CH3 : PIR sensor to check resence of a human nearby

Descion Tree 
08
THEIRS : Entropy and Gini and shown in debug 

MQTT
10
THEIRS: 
PROCEDURE:
hardware:
1) connect HW-827 to Rapberry pi
	vcc – pin 2 (5v)
	gnd – gnd
	signal – GPIO17 (PIN 11)
2) Set mqtt nodes in node-red(publisher adn broker)
3) create function node
4) dashboard node

components:
pulse oxiometer,raspberry pi ,jump wires

Time Series Analysis
11
Generates a random power value every 2 seconds.
Displays the average of the last 10 values on a chart and a debug console.
Turns on a LED indicator if the value exceeds 100.
Saves the values with a timestamp and an "alert" status to a CSV file.
